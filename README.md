# tiny-trello


My tiny Trelloâ€™s project in Ember.JS. I spent a few days learning Ember since last Friday(when the coding challenge was given). I followed the tutorial guide from the Ember's official website and created my first app in Ember before starting Trello's project.

I spent a lot of time learning how Ember works, then I started my own Trello app. You can add the list(s) and items, descriptions with custom's names. You can also edit/delete the item/description. However, there's a problem while deleting an item with a description. That particular list doesn't allow any more items or descriptions to be added or changed or deleted. The error points to "Mirage" and states that (deleted) ID not found in the database. I have used the Ember's documents, and searched online.

I look forward to learning Ember.js on this position and grow up as a better developer.
